## scotty at cmu - school power specs

### home base (the cut)
- starter ability: zoomies
- early unlock: territory (quick tutorial unlock)
- purpose: teach movement + survival loop before school missions

### hamerschlag hall - college of engineering
- mission: reactivate 3 power relays in order
- unlock power: `coil turret`
- coil turret effect: drop a compact sentry that tracks and fires while scotty repositions
- unique mechanic: turret can be picked up and redeployed to create moving strongholds
- helper support: engineering crew can remotely repair one destroyed turret per encounter

### gates hillman complex - school of computer science
- mission: route a live data path across unstable network nodes
- unlock power: `target patch`
- target patch effect: mark one goop cluster so shots chain to nearby marked targets
- unique mechanic: creates short "focus windows" where auto-shoot behaves like smart burst control
- helper support: cs students deploy quick hotfix pulses that refresh one focus window

### newell-simon hall - robotics institute
- mission: wake 2 disabled campus rovers and escort them to a charging bay
- unlock power: `bot buddy`
- bot buddy effect: summon an ri rover that scouts ahead and tags goops for focus fire
- unique mechanic: rover can body-block lanes and briefly hold a choke point
- helper support: ri staff can overclock rover mode for a short high-speed cleanup burst

### wean hall - physics + cs crossover
- mission: stabilize 3 oscillating field anchors (timing windows)
- unlock power: `repel field`
- repel field effect: emit a directional pulse that bends goop movement and clears a lane
- unique mechanic: projectiles passing through the field curve and can hit around corners
- helper support: physics lab techs can lock field polarity for a brief "safe lane" window

### mellon institute - chemistry
- mission: complete safe reagent sequence
- unlock power: `catalyst mix`
- catalyst mix effect: territory puddles can be "primed" into sticky gel or corrosive solvent modes
- unique mechanic: mode swap changes control style (trap-heavy vs damage-heavy) on demand
- helper support: chem staff periodically drop reagent packs that instantly re-prime one puddle

### baker hall - psychology
- mission: calm panic waves with short timing prompts
- unlock power: `focus bark`
- focus bark effect: a rhythm bark pulse disrupts nearby goops and breaks swarm formation
- unique mechanic: repeated well-timed pulses build "confidence," spawning brief volunteer assists
- helper support: psych students coordinate evac lanes that appear as temporary safe paths

## final boss setup - goop core
- boss name: `the dean of goop`
- gate rule: boss becomes realistically beatable only after 3+ school unlocks
- full strength route: clear all 6 schools for complete support stack
- boss behavior notes:
  - phase 1: sends goop waves
  - phase 2: arena puddle pressure
  - phase 3: aggressive rush + add spawns
